# PHPYAM

Really simple, yet easily extendable, MVC framework for PHP developers.

Based on Mini, rewritten to add following features:
- URL forwarding support
- ajax requests support
- protection against multiple form submissions
- error logging using log4php
- define the client's charset encoding
- htaccess support
- session support
- output buffering support
- user authentication support
- internationalization of the PHPYam error messages

PHPYam doesn't do yet:
- form validation

## Installation

It's recommended that you use Composer to install PHPYAM.

```bash
composer require tbl0605/phpyam:1.*
```
